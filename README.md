# Information
These are soundpacks I created for use with my Dreame vacuums that have been rooted with Valetudo([Hypfer/Valetudo](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo)). I own none of the sounds in these packs, unless otherwise stated. All I did was create the packs for others. Some of the packs here contain sounds that may be deemed NSFW, I will mark that out in the title of the pack.
# How To Install
## Memz Soundpack (NSFW Pack)
This one is my first pack so don't judge me. It contains a sound for EVERY sound any Dreame vacuum can make. So from startup to shutdown this pack will make your vacuum spout the craziest stuff you've ever heard. Many sounds contained in this pack are NSFW.
